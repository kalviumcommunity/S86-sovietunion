# Soviet Union App

This project is a Flutter application.

## Folder Structure

The project follows a feature-driven directory structure to promote modularity and scalability.

```
lib/
├── main.dart          # Entry point of your app
├── screens/           # Individual UI screens for each feature
├── widgets/           # Reusable UI components shared across the app
├── models/            # Data models representing the app's data structures
├── services/          # Business logic, API calls, and other services
```

### Directory Purpose

- **`lib/`**: The main container for all Dart code in the application.
- **`main.dart`**: The entry point of the application. It initializes the app and sets up the root widget.
- **`screens/`**: Contains the primary UI screens of the application. Each screen is typically a separate file and represents a major feature or view.
- **`widgets/`**: Holds reusable UI components that can be shared across multiple screens. This promotes code reuse and a consistent UI.
- **`models/`**: Defines the data structures for the application. These are plain Dart classes that represent the data fetched from an API or used within the app.
- **`services/`**: Contains the business logic of the application, such as API communication, database interactions, and other background services.

### Modular App Design

This folder structure supports a modular app design by separating concerns:

- **UI (`screens/`, `widgets/`)**: The UI is kept separate from the business logic, making it easier to modify the look and feel of the app without affecting the underlying functionality.
- **Data (`models/`)**: By defining data models in one place, we ensure a consistent data structure throughout the app.
- **Logic (`services/`)**: Centralizing business logic makes it easier to manage and test.

This separation allows different developers to work on different parts of the app simultaneously with minimal conflicts.

### Naming Conventions

To maintain a clean and readable codebase, we follow these naming conventions:

- **Files**: `snake_case.dart` (e.g., `home_screen.dart`, `custom_button.dart`).
- **Classes**: `PascalCase` (e.g., `HomeScreen`, `CustomButton`).
- **Widgets**: `PascalCase` for widget classes (e.g., `CustomButton`).
- **Variables and Functions**: `camelCase` (e.g., `userName`, `fetchUserData()`).
- **Constants**: `camelCase` or `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for top-level constants.
